The ATM Machine System is a simple Java-based console application that simulates the basic operations of an automated teller machine. It allows users to perform common banking functions such as checking account balance, depositing money, and withdrawing cash. The program begins by prompting the user to set a personal PIN, which is then used for authentication. Once authenticated, the user is presented with a menu to interact with the system. The core features include viewing the current account balance, depositing funds, and withdrawing money with proper checks for sufficient balance. The system uses modular methods for each operation (account(), deposit(), withdraw()), improving code readability and reusability. Although the project does not use advanced OOP principles like abstraction or inheritance, it effectively demonstrates control flow, user input handling, method usage, and basic financial logic. This program serves as a foundational project for beginners learning Java and can be extended to include features like multiple user accounts, persistent storage, or object-oriented enhancements.
